    abstract = {Dynamic, interpreted languages, like Python, are attractive for domain-experts and
    scientists experimenting with new ideas. However, the performance of the interpreter
    is often a barrier when scaling to larger data sets. This paper presents a just-in-time
    compiler for Python that focuses in scientific and array-oriented computing. Starting
    with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient
    machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language.
    In addition, we share our experience in building a JIT compiler using LLVM[1].},
